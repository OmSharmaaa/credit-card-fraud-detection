# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression.

## 🔍 Project Summary
- Built on the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset (284,807 transactions).
- Achieved 93% accuracy using Logistic Regression with feature scaling and class balancing (SMOTE).
- Evaluated using accuracy.

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy Score
- Used `accuracy_score` from Scikit-learn to evaluate model performance on test data.
- Model predicts transaction class (fraud or not fraud) based on features using `.predict()` method.
- Accuracy on test set: **93%**

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas
